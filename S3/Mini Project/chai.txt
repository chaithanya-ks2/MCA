Yes, you're on the right track! Here's a breakdown of what you should do with the **YOLO outputs** (coordinates + timestamps) and how **DeepSORT** and **Action Detection** come into play.

---

## ✅ Summary: What YOLO Gives You

For each frame, YOLO provides:

* **Bounding boxes (coordinates)** for:

  * People
  * Waste bins
* **Class labels** (e.g., person, green bin, red bin)
* **Timestamps/frame number** for when detection occurred

This tells you **who is where** and **when**.

## 🚀 Next Steps: Building Action Detection Pipeline

Here’s how to proceed step-by-step:

---

### **Step 1: Use DeepSORT for Tracking**

* **Purpose**: Track the same person **across multiple frames** using their bounding box + appearance features.
* DeepSORT adds a **track ID** to each detected person — this helps you know:

  * Which person is performing the action
  * Where they moved
  * Whether they went near a bin
* It uses the YOLO detections + optical flow to track movement.

🔄 **Input to DeepSORT**:

* YOLO detections (bbox, timestamp, person ID)
* Sequence of frames (video or image folder)

🔁 **Output from DeepSORT**:

* Continuous **person trajectories** (with same ID)
* Optionally, a cropped sequence of frames per person (for action detection)

---

### **Step 2: Extract Short Video Clips (Per Person)**

* Use the **tracked person** from DeepSORT to extract **video snippets** or frame sequences (e.g., 2–4 seconds) where:

  * The person moves **near a bin**
  * The person performs an action

You can do this by:

* Looking at the bounding box trajectory of the person
* Checking when the person is **close to a bin** (bin's bbox) using IoU or distance threshold
* Extracting N frames **before and after** that interaction (e.g., 30 frames at 15 FPS = 2 seconds)

---

### **Step 3: Run Action Detection Model**

* Use the **cropped person video clip** as input to an action recognition model:

  * Pretrained model (e.g., I3D, SlowFast, or TimeSformer trained on Kinetics)
  * Finetuned if needed on your specific keywords (e.g., throwing, ignoring, placing)

🔍 The model will output:

* Action label: "throwing", "walking", "dropping", "ignoring"
* Confidence score

### **Step 4: Logic Layer – Decide If Action Was Correct**

Now you combine all the info:

| Person ID | Action   | Bin Type | Bin Color | Distance | Result      |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| 5         | Throwing | Present  | Green     | Near     | ✅ Correct   |
| 12        | Walking  | Present  | Red       | Near     | ❌ Ignored   |
| 8         | Dropping | Absent   | N/A       | Far      | ❌ Misplaced |

Use logic to evaluate:

* Was there a **bin nearby**?
* Was the **bin color correct** for the assumed waste type?
* Did the person **actually throw/drop** something in?

## 🔁 Loop: Automate for Each Person in Video

1. Run YOLO → detect people and bins frame-by-frame
2. Track people using DeepSORT
3. For each person:

   * Check proximity to bins
   * Extract short clip
   * Run action detection
   * Log result (correct/incorrect usage)

## ✅ Tools You’ll Be Using

| Task             | Tool                                           |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Object Detection | YOLO (e.g., YOLOv5, YOLOv8)                    |
| Object Tracking  | DeepSORT                                       |
| Action Detection | I3D, SlowFast, TimeSformer (with Kinetics-400) |
| Logic/Decision   | Custom Python script or rule-based module      |

## 🧩 Optional Enhancements

* **Zone mapping**: Define zones around each bin for proximity checks
* **Temporal consistency**: Use motion vectors or optical flow to better detect "throwing" motion
* **Multi-class bin classification**: Detect green vs red vs blue bins precisely
* **Dataset refinement**: Fine-tune action models with examples of real college disposal actions

## ✅ Conclusion

> So yes — after YOLO gives you coordinates + timestamps, you should:
>
> 1. Track people using DeepSORT
> 2. Extract short clips around interaction points
> 3. Run action detection on those clips
> 4. Decide if the action was correct, using bin location/color + action type
