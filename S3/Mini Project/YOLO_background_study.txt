YOLO
You Only Look Once
-real-time object detection algorithm
- combines classification and prediction of bounding boxes for detected ()objects using a single neural network
(was multi-step process)
-heavily optimized
- much faster than running two separate neural networks
- repurposing traditional image classifier

Object Detection and Bounding Boxes
___________________________________

in image classification we assume that there is only one major object in the image, and we only focus on how to recognize its category.
for multiple objects - category and sepcific position in the image
we refer to such tasks as object detection (onject recognition)
